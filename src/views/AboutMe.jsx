              <p>
                After graduating from UC Santa Barbara in 2018, I began work as
                a Research Fellow with the{" "}

                  Center For Mindfulness and Human Potential (CMHP)
                </a>
                . Here I played a critical role in the development and
                maintenance of a Minfulness Education App â€“{" "}

                  Finding Focus
                </a>
                . This is where my interest in software development was sparked.
              </p>
              <p>
                Following my fellowship with the CMHP, I split my time between
                working as a Behavioral Therapist and a Junior Developer Intern.
                As a therapist, I learned invaluable lessons about human
                compassion, trauma and mental illness. And as a developer, I
                learned to solve complex, software problems through
                experimentation, testing and collaboration.

              <p>Then COVID happened...</p>
              <p>
                Amidst the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, I decided
                to expand my skills as a software developer. After just a few
                months of diligent studying, I started my first full-time
                position as a Full Stack Developer with World Prints -- a small
                T-shirt printing company based out of Los Angeles. Here I
                acquired expertise in database design, backend development,
                frontend UI/UX design and a plethora of other valuable skills.
