          Student turned Researcher, turned Therapist, turned Software
          Developer, here's how it happened... As a student at UC Santa Barbara
          (2014-2018) I studied psychology and worked 2 jobs, the
          "Back-of-House'' at a small restaurant in Goleta and also Front Desk
          Agent at a luxury hotel. Eventually I got extremely interested in
          research and I began working in Psych. labs with a focus on
          Developmental Psychology and Therapy. At the same time I left my 2
          service jobs for a new position as a Behavioral Therapist (~goodbye
          tips and angry customers). As a therapist, I worked with individuals
          diagnosed with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) and gained a valuable
          new perspective on mental health issues.{" "}

          Before graduating from UCSB I completed my senior thesis on how young
          children conceptualize race all while being a full-time student and
          therapist. Following graduation, I was presented with an awesome
          opportunity to study Mindfulness alongside some experts in the field.
          And so I joined the CMPH (Center for Mindfulness and Human Potential
          at UCSB) to conduct research on how Mindfulness and Meditation can be
          used to reduce stress and anxiety, improve concentration, and elevate
          our overall mental health. My time there has forever ingrained the
          value of meditation within me.{" "}

          Following my research fellowship at the CMHP, I continued my work as a
          therapist and began teaching mindfulness-meditation. Then COVID
          happened and everything came to a halt... But I did not waver, I used
          my free time to learn a new skill, software development. And now I
          seek to join those 2 paths together by creating impactful web/mobile
          applications that help make our lives easier so that we can focus more
          on living.
